    "Information captured by persistent homology is commonly represented by the persistence diagram or, equivalently, a persistence barcode. Even if mathematically sound, these representations are not well suited for exploratory data analysis. They represent effectively the lifespan of each topological feature but they loose connection with the original domain space.\n",
